#imageNoiseAnalyst

Using OpenCV-Python to develop a toolkit for image noise analysing and help user to find solutions. This program is set as a tool for image processing application in my lab.

##Target
1. DFT2 analysing (Done)
2. Background noise analysing
3. Sin wave noise (Done)
4. ROI zooming (Done)
5. histogram

##Requirement
1. Python 2.7 or higher ( Test with Python 2.7.8 )
2. python-opencv ( Test with opencv 2.4.4 )
3. matplotlib ( Test with matplolib 1.4.3)

##Thanks
1. [dungtn/gaborfun](https://github.com/dungtn/gaborfun) is a good tool on Gabor filter, though not suitable for the test image.
